# Skills Assessment Framework

*Evaluate your current abilities and track progress throughout your transition*

## üìã Assessment Instructions

Rate yourself on each skill area using this scale:
- **0**: No experience
- **1**: Beginner (basic concepts, needs guidance)
- **2**: Intermediate (can work independently on simple tasks)
- **3**: Advanced (can handle complex tasks, can teach others)
- **4**: Expert (deep understanding, can architect solutions)
