# API Types Reference Guide

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive reference for understanding different types of APIs, their characteristics, differences, and ideal use cases.

---

## 1. REST API (Representational State Transfer)

### Description
REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It's the most widely used approach for building web APIs.

### Key Characteristics
- Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- Stateless communication (no client context stored on server)
- Resource-based URLs (e.g., `/users/123`)
- Returns data typically in JSON or XML format
- Cacheable responses for improved performance
- Uniform interface and client-server separation

### Best Used For
- Public-facing web services and APIs
- Mobile applications
- Microservices architecture
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources
- When simplicity and scalability are priorities
- Systems requiring caching capabilities

### Example Usage
```
GET /api/users/123          # Retrieve user with ID 123
POST /api/users             # Create a new user
PUT /api/users/123          # Update user 123
DELETE /api/users/123       # Delete user 123
```

### Pros
- Simple and intuitive
- Great caching support
- Stateless and scalable
- Wide tooling and community support
- Language and platform agnostic

### Cons
- Can lead to over-fetching or under-fetching of data
- Multiple round trips may be needed for complex data
- No built-in real-time capabilities
- Versioning can become complex

---

## 2. GraphQL

### Description
A query language for APIs developed by Facebook that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, nothing more and nothing less.

### Key Characteristics
- Single endpoint for all requests (typically `/graphql`)
- Client specifies exactly what data to return in the query
- Strongly typed schema with introspection capabilities
- Reduces over-fetching and under-fetching problems
- Supports real-time updates through subscriptions
- Nested queries for related data

### Best Used For
- Complex data requirements with nested resources
- Mobile apps with bandwidth constraints
- Applications needing flexible, dynamic data queries
- Rapid frontend development without backend changes
- When you want to minimize number of API requests
- Applications with diverse client needs (web, mobile, IoT)

### Example Usage
```graphql
query {
  user(id: 123) {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
      comments {
        text
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Pros
- Fetch exactly what you need in one request
- Strongly typed schema
- Excellent for complex, nested data
- Self-documenting with introspection
- Versionless API evolution

### Cons
- Higher learning curve than REST
- More complex to implement on the server
- Caching is more difficult
- Can expose too much data if not properly secured
- Query complexity can lead to performance issues

## 3. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)

### Description
A protocol specification for exchanging structured information in web services, using XML for message format.

### Key Characteristics
- XML-based messaging protocol
- Built-in error handling (SOAP faults)
- WS-Security standard for enterprise-grade security
- ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance support
- Strict standards and contracts defined by WSDL (Web Services Description Language)
- Protocol independent (can use HTTP, SMTP, TCP, etc.)

### Best Used For
- Enterprise applications requiring high security and reliability
- Financial transactions and payment processing systems
- Legacy system integration
- When ACID compliance is required
- Formal contracts between distributed services
- Telecommunications and high-stakes industries

### Example Usage
```xml
<soap:Envelope>
  <soap:Body>
    <GetUserRequest>
      <UserId>123</UserId>
    </GetUserRequest>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

### Pros
- Extensive security features (WS-Security)
- Built-in ACID compliance
- Language and platform independent
- Formal contracts via WSDL
- Better error handling

### Cons
- Very verbose XML format (larger payload)
- Slower performance due to XML parsing
- Steep learning curve
- Less flexible than REST or GraphQL
- Declining popularity in favor of REST

## 4. gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)

### Description
A modern, high-performance RPC framework developed by Google that uses HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers for serialization.

### Key Characteristics
- Uses HTTP/2 for transport (multiplexing, header compression)
- Binary serialization with Protocol Buffers (protobuf)
- Bidirectional streaming support
- Language-agnostic with automatic code generation
- Extremely fast and efficient
- Built-in authentication, load balancing, and more

### Best Used For
- Microservices communication (service-to-service)
- Real-time streaming applications
- IoT devices and mobile-to-backend communication
- High-performance, low-latency requirements
- Polyglot environments needing strong type safety
- Internal APIs where efficiency is critical

### Example Usage
```protobuf
// Define service in .proto file
service UserService {
  rpc GetUser (UserRequest) returns (UserResponse);
}

// Client call (pseudo-code)
response = client.GetUser(userId: 123)
```

### Pros
- Extremely fast (up to 10x faster than REST)
- Strongly typed contracts
- Excellent for microservices
- Bidirectional streaming
- Automatic code generation for multiple languages

### Cons
- Not human-readable (binary format)
- Limited browser support
- Steeper learning curve
- Debugging is more difficult
- Less suitable for public APIs

## 5. WebSocket

### Description
A communication protocol providing full-duplex, bidirectional communication channels over a single TCP connection.

### Key Characteristics
- Persistent connection between client and server
- Real-time bidirectional communication
- Low latency and minimal overhead after connection established
- Server can push data to clients without polling
- Starts as HTTP connection then upgrades to WebSocket protocol
- Uses `ws://` or `wss://` (secure) protocol

### Best Used For
- Chat applications and instant messaging
- Live notifications and activity feeds
- Collaborative editing tools (Google Docs-like)
- Online multiplayer gaming
- Real-time dashboards and monitoring systems
- Live sports scores and financial tickers

### Example Usage
```javascript
// Client-side JavaScript
const socket = new WebSocket('wss://example.com/socket');

socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log('Received:', event.data);
};

socket.send('Hello Server!');
```

### Pros
- True real-time communication
- Low latency after connection
- Bidirectional data flow
- Reduced overhead compared to polling
- Excellent for live updates

### Cons
- Persistent connections consume server resources
- More complex to implement and scale
- Requires special infrastructure/load balancers
- Not suitable for request-response patterns
- Connection can drop and needs reconnection logic

---

## 6. Webhook

### Description
User-defined HTTP callbacks that are triggered by specific events, allowing real-time notifications from one system to another.

### Key Characteristics
- Push-based model (server sends to client URL)
- Event-driven architecture
- Simple HTTP POST requests (usually)
- No need for constant polling by the client
- Typically one-way communication
- Client provides an endpoint URL to receive events

### Best Used For
- Payment processing notifications (Stripe, PayPal)
- CI/CD pipeline triggers (GitHub, GitLab webhooks)
- Third-party service integrations
- Event notifications without constant polling
- Automating workflows based on external events
- Real-time notifications from SaaS platforms

### Example Usage
```json
// GitHub webhook payload when code is pushed
POST https://your-app.com/webhook/github
{
  "event": "push",
  "repository": "my-repo",
  "commits": [...]
}
```

### Pros
- Real-time notifications
- No polling overhead
- Simple to implement
- Event-driven and efficient
- Reduces API rate limit concerns

### Cons
- Requires publicly accessible endpoint
- Security considerations (signature verification)
- No guarantee of delivery
- Difficult to debug
- Client must handle retries and duplicates
